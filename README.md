## Intended Layout

For this website, I decided to create a high-level overview of the topic, which is New York City. There is a homepage, 3 pages to represent the 3 subtopics (people, food, and places), and also the survey/signup page. The h tags are consistent across all of the subpages. At the top is an intro (h2) with 1 paragraph, then an overview (h2) with 2 more detailed paragrapgs, and then the specifics section (also h2) with three single paragraphs labeled with h3 tags.

I came across this particular sample page on the bootstrap website: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/examples/jumbotron/, and I really liked the way that looked, so I went ahead and built the homepage to look like the sample. The rest of the pages, however, are relying on the default bootstrap styles for the time being.

I've always liked the way our team's assignment 3 layout was done, a simple F-pattern which can be found at http://urcsc174.org/midterm/lfusilli/about.php. I created a similar solution for my midterm (http://urcsc174.org/midterm/lfusilli/about.php). I feel that this type of look would work well for the structure of the pages.

## Intended mood/feeling

A modern look seems most appropriate to complement the always forward-thinking city of New York. To achieve this, there should be abundant spacing between elements, and also exclusively sans-serif fonts should be used. It would be great if the overall look and feel of the website could be reminiscent of the NYC subway system. A dark background (but not black because that wouldn't look great on a screen), with primarily white text for the body but then vibrantly colored headings and buttons perhaps, to emulate the different colored subway lines. I installed bootstrap mainly so I could achieve the look I was going for on the homepage, but if the designer prefers to create his own CSS that works too.

## Intended Interactivity

For the admin system, I found this particular version from phpflow (https://www.phpflow.com/php/addedit-delete-record-using-bootgrid-php-mysql/) to be relatively straightforward easy to implement. However, if the coder is more comfortable using a different system, that is totally fine. 

I also put the required survey on its own page, and listed the action attribute as "survey.php" (script to be created by the coder).
